Location Analysis: A map visual that shows the popular pickup and dropoff locations in Bangalore, categorized by cab type 📍.
Data Analysis 🔎
Revenue Distribution: Analyzed how Uber’s revenue is distributed across the days of the week. By examining the revenue trends, I identified peak and off-peak days, revealing opportunities for targeted promotions or operational adjustments 💵.
Cab Type and Payment Method: Investigated the combinations of cab types (e.g., UberX, UberXL) and payment methods (e.g., Credit Card, Cash) to understand customer preferences and identify the most popular combinations 🏷️.
Ride Frequency: Analyzed ride frequency by hour of the day to identify peak ride times and low-demand periods, valuable for planning Uber’s availability during specific hours ⏳.
Distance vs. Fare: Examined the relationship between distance traveled and fare charged to identify discrepancies or patterns that might indicate pricing inconsistencies or customer behavior 🛣️💰.
Flow from Pickup to Dropoff: Used a Sankey diagram to visualize the flow from pickup to dropoff locations, highlighting the most common routes and potential areas for service expansion or optimization 🚕🌍.
Power BI Visualizations 📊
I created the following visualizations to present the findings:

Stacked Bar Chart: Shows revenue distribution across days of the week 📅.
Line Chart: Displays ride frequency by hour of the day ⏰.
Donut Chart: Highlights the share of different payment methods used 💳.
Pie/Bar Chart: Displays the distribution of cab types used 🚖.
Map: Shows popular pickup and dropoff locations in Bangalore with cab type distribution 📍.
Project Learnings 🏆
In this project, I’ve gained practical knowledge in several key areas:

Data Analysis: Conducting detailed analysis on revenue trends, customer preferences, and operational patterns 📊.
Power BI Visualization: Creating and customizing a wide range of visualizations to effectively communicate insights from the data 🎨.

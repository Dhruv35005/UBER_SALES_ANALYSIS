**Project Overview**
This analysis project explores various aspects of Uber ride data, including:

**Revenue Distribution:** Understanding the sales trend across different days of the week.
**Payment Methods: Analysis** of payment preferences across different cab types.
**Ride Frequency:** Analyzing ride frequency based on different hours of the day and days of the week.
**Customer Preferences:** Understanding customer behavior based on ride type and payment method combinations.

**Technologies Used**

**Power BI:** For data visualization and creating interactive reports.
**SQL:** For data extraction and analysis.

**Uber Sales Analysis Project - What I Learned and Created**
For my Uber Sales Analysis project, I’ve not only created visualizations but also performed in-depth analysis to uncover key insights. Here’s what I’ve done:
1. Data Analysis:

  Revenue Distribution: I analyzed how Uber’s revenue is distributed across the days of the week. By examining the revenue trends, I was able to identify peak and off-peak days, revealing                               potential opportunities for targeted promotions or operational adjustments.
  Cab Type and Payment Method: I analyzed the combinations of cab types (e.g., UberX, UberXL) and payment methods (e.g., Credit Card, Cash). This allowed me to understand customer preferences                          and identify which cab types and payment methods are most popular among riders.
  Ride Frequency: By analyzing the frequency of rides by hour of the day, I identified peak ride times and low-demand periods. This is valuable for planning Uber’s availability during specific                         hours.
  Distance vs. Fare: I examined the relationship between distance traveled and fare charged to check for any discrepancies or patterns that might indicate pricing inconsistencies or customer                           behavior.
  Flow from Pickup to Dropoff: Using a Sankey diagram, I visualized the flow from pickup to dropoff locations, highlighting the most common routes and potential areas for service expansion or                          optimization.
  
2. Power BI Visualizations:

   I created various visualizations to present the findings:
   
      Stacked Bar Chart for revenue distribution across days of the week.
      Line Chart for ride frequency by hour of the day.
      Donut Chart for the percentage share of each payment method.
      Pie/Bar Chart to display the distribution of cab types used.
      Map to display the popular pickup and dropoff location.

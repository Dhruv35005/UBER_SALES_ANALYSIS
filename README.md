## Data Analysis

- **Revenue Distribution**: Analyzed how Uber’s revenue is distributed across the days of the week. By examining the revenue trends, I identified peak and off-peak days, revealing opportunities for targeted promotions or operational adjustments 💵.
- **Cab Type and Payment Method**: Investigated the combinations of cab types (e.g., UberX, UberXL) and payment methods (e.g., Credit Card, Cash) to understand customer preferences and identify the most popular combinations 🏷️.
- **Ride Frequency**: Analyzed ride frequency by hour of the day to identify peak ride times and low-demand periods, valuable for planning Uber’s availability during specific hours ⏳.
- **Distance vs. Fare**: Examined the relationship between distance traveled and fare charged to identify discrepancies or patterns that might indicate pricing inconsistencies or customer behavior 🛣️💰.
- **Flow from Pickup to Dropoff**: Used a **Sankey diagram** to visualize the flow from pickup to dropoff locations, highlighting the most common routes and potential areas for service expansion or optimization 🚕🌍.

## Power BI Visualizations

I created the following visualizations to present the findings:

1. **Stacked Bar Chart**: Shows revenue distribution across days of the week 📅.
2. **Line Chart**: Displays ride frequency by hour of the day ⏰.
3. **Donut Chart**: Highlights the share of different payment methods used 💳.
4. **Pie/Bar Chart**: Displays the distribution of cab types used 🚖.
5. **Map**: Shows popular pickup and dropoff locations in Bangalore with cab type distribution 📍.
